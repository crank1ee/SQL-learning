Select LastName, REPLACE(LastName, '- Fired', '') as LastNameFixed  -- replace value with new one, blank in this case

--Storage procedure-----
CREATE PROCEDURE Temp_Employee2  ---- it creates query that we can execute late. in this case creating temp table
AS
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS #temp_Employee2
Create Table #temp_Employee2 (
Jobtitle varchar(50),
EmployeesPerJob int,
AvgAge int,
AvgSalary int
)
Insert into #temp_Employee2

Group by JobTitle

SELECT *
FROM #temp_Employee2
----till this point-----        
----Exec Temp_Employee2

---- changing the procedure------
--We can change procedure to got into it (modify), for example
USE [SQLTutorial]
GO
/****** Object:  StoredProcedure [dbo].[Temp_Employee2]    Script Date: 16.11.2022 11:01:10 ******/
SET ANSI_NULLS ON
GO
SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON
GO
ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[Temp_Employee2] --our stored procedure
@Jobtitle nvarchar(100)  ---- this adding input from uses procedure
AS
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS #temp_Employee2
Create Table #temp_Employee2 (
Jobtitle varchar(50),
EmployeesPerJob int,
AvgAge int,
AvgSalary int
)
Insert into #temp_Employee2

FROM SQLTutorial.dbo.EmployeeDemographics AS demo
JOIN SQLTutorial.dbo.EmployeeSalary AS sal
ON Demo.EmployeeID=sal.EmployeeID
WHERE Jobtitle = @Jobtitle  --- added to query based on input from user
Group by JobTitle

SELECT *
FROM #temp_Employee2

---------- Exec Temp_Employee2 @JobTitle = 'Accountant' ----- call of procedure with new input

----SUBQUERIES----

---Subquery in Select

Select EmployeeID, Salary, (Select AVG(Salary) FROM EmployeeSalary) AS AvgSalary
From EmployeeSalary

---- with Partition BY

Select EmployeeID, Salary,  AVG(Salary) over () AS AllAvgSalary  --- without over() it wont work, because avg salary would be aggregate value
From EmployeeSalary

-- Why Group By doesn't work
Select EmployeeID, Salary,  AVG(Salary) AS AllAvgSalary  --- won't work correctly, because we are grouping only 1 value show
From EmployeeSalary
Group by EmployeeID, Salary
order by 1,2

-------------------------

-- SUbquery in From

Select a.employeeID, AllAvgSalary
From (Select employeeID, Salary, AVG(Salary) over () as AllAvgSalary
	From EmployeeSalary) a                  ---- Temp and CTE are more usefull and memory friendly

--- Subquery in Where

Select EmployeeID, Jobtitle, Salary
From EmployeeSalary
Where EmployeeID in (
	Select EmployeeID
	From EmployeeDemographics
	Where AGE>30)
